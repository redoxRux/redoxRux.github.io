raw notes and daily updates.

okay okay okay,

as coach carter says  "What is your deepest fear?"

"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
 Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 
 It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us..."

we often get stuck at something, doing the obvious thing and which will look like silly eventually
 these are the notes that I wrote today:

 - we appreciate power
 - the deepest fear which is already above
 - we often try to normalize too many things , so that things/env feel comfortable
 - we can actually think from other angles, we can actually allow others to express their view
 - we often look away from what we already know
 - why dont people think from the first principle
 - why cant people allow themselves to change their perspective on a particular project? we can look at other projects/products which are perfect  inspiration


- I forgot another; I should have written it !!
- this is it : we often think that we are working on something ; which is like a layer, a creamy layer instead of that just drink the coffee !!

I am here to create difference

the first paper should be the one to implement

here is the thing; I thought of creating .plan for all but I think its best to create one for all and in detail for the dir that I am going to create; I have to explore is there a way to do a shared or cloud way of doing things; so that it will be platform independent and I can work easily.

I really hate to mention date, because it feels off. but if its mentioned easily in the push or commit we can just ignore it; or I will mention date at the end; also why i should be uppercase?

is it good to maintain it as a separate site or should I make it as a separate section!?

Its time to become the jacked nerd !! again??

I have to read that book ; masters of doom
