I am here to create difference

the first paper should be the one to implement

here is the thing; I thought of creating .plan for all but I think its best to create one for all and in detail for the dir that I am going to create; I have to explore is there a way to do a shared or cloud way of doing things; so that it will be platform independent and I can work easily.

I really hate to mention date, because it feels off. but if its mentioned easily in the push or commit we can just ignore it; or I will mention date at the end; also why i should be uppercase?

is it good to maintain it as a separate site or should I make it as a separate section!?

Its time to become the jacked nerd !! again??

I have to read that book ; masters of doom
