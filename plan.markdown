 Criticism seems sophisticated, and making new things often seems awkward, especially at first; and yet it's precisely those first steps that are most rare and valuable - [pg](https://www.paulgraham.com/do.html)

 0 frameworks were used to make [this](https://karpathy.ai/) simple responsive website because I am becoming seriously allergic to [500-pound websites](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/). this one is pure HTML and CSS in two static files and that's it. — Andrej Karpathy 

 “I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution. We became too self aware; nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, a secretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody’s nobody. I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.”

 “You, yourself, this whole big drama, it was never more than a jerry rig of presumption and dumb will, and you could just let go. To finally know that you didn't have to hold on so tight. To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person.”

My old manager asked me what I wanted to be. I said the GOAT. He told me: "define what GOAT means. Can you take measurable steps toward that path, and are you doing it one by one? That way you will know you are on the right path."

 Sometimes it might not be easy, but you still have a way.

Another thing he told me:" if you are very ambitious, you should be like a magnet, absorbing everything at a faster rate—more knowledge, more things to do."


a good one right?

This quote hits me:
"If you want to win the lottery, then at least pay for the ticket."
I haven't seen the movie yet, but maybe it says something deep about karma or the task that you have to do.

okay okay okay,

as coach carter says  "What is your deepest fear?"

"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
 Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 
 It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us..."

we often get stuck at something, doing the obvious thing and which will look like silly eventually
 these are the notes that I wrote today:

 - we appreciate power
 - the deepest fear which is already above
 - we often try to normalize too many things , so that things/env feel comfortable
 - we can actually think from other angles, we can actually allow others to express their view
 - we often look away from what we already know
 - why dont people think from the first principle
 - why cant people allow themselves to change their perspective on a particular project? we can look at other projects/products which are perfect  inspiration


- I forgot another; I should have written it !!
- this is it : we often think that we are working on something ; which is like a layer, a creamy layer instead of that just drink the coffee !!

I am here to create difference

the first paper should be the one to implement

here is the thing; I thought of creating .plan for all but I think its best to create one for all and in detail for the dir that I am going to create; I have to explore is there a way to do a shared or cloud way of doing things; so that it will be platform independent and I can work easily.

I really hate to mention date, because it feels off. but if its mentioned easily in the push or commit we can just ignore it; or I will mention date at the end; also why i should be uppercase?

is it good to maintain it as a separate site or should I make it as a separate section!?

Its time to become the jacked nerd !! again??

I have to read that book ; masters of doom
