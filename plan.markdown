“I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution. We became too self aware; nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, a secretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody’s nobody. I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.”
― Rustin Cohle


“You, yourself, this whole big drama, it was never more than a jerry rig of presumption and dumb will, and you could just let go. To finally know that you didn't have to hold on so tight. To realize that all your life, all your love, all your hate, all your memories, all your pain, it was all the same thing. It was all the same dream, a dream that you had inside a locked room, a dream about being a person.”
― Rustin Cohle

okay okay okay,

as coach carter says  "What is your deepest fear?"

"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
 Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. 
 It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us..."

I am here to create difference

the first paper should be the one to implement

here is the thing; I thought of creating .plan for all but I think its best to create one for all and in detail for the dir that I am going to create; I have to explore is there a way to do a shared or cloud way of doing things; so that it will be platform independent and I can work easily.

I really hate to mention date, because it feels off. but if its mentioned easily in the push or commit we can just ignore it; or I will mention date at the end; also why i should be uppercase?

is it good to maintain it as a separate site or should I make it as a separate section!?

Its time to become the jacked nerd !! again??

I have to read that book ; masters of doom
